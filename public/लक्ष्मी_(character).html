        This record intends to develop a description of that aspect or version of <span style="font-weight: bold">लक्ष्मी</span> (<span style="font-weight: bold">Lakṣmī</span>) which could be classified as being an IFLA FRBR<span style="vertical-align: sub">OO</span> F38 Character, subclass of the CIDOC CRM E28 Conceptual Object.
        FRBR<span style="vertical-align: sub">OO</span> F38 Character’s scope note says:
        <blockquote>
            “This class comprises fictional or iconographic individuals or groups of individuals (including families) appearing in works in a way relevant as subjects. Characters may be purely fictitious or based on real persons or groups, but as characters they may exhibit properties that would be inconsistent with a real person or group. Rather than merging characters with real persons, they should be described as disjoint, but related entities.”
        </blockquote>
        Lakṣmī is certainly iconographic, and her appearances in devotional literature and works of art are taken by a vast many to be based on a real (though divinely distinct from our world) person.
        The author of this page worships that Lakṣmī may be a real person in her own world, but chooses for the sake of bibliographical exactitude to specify, in this record, that disjoint but related entity that is her character self.
        Further relationships can be built from here, but this approach seems like a very safe beginning.
