        This record intends to develop a description of that aspect or version of <span style="font-weight: bold">लक्ष्मी</span> (<span style="font-weight: bold">Lakṣmī</span>) which could be classified as being an IFLA <a href="#1">FRBRoo</a> <span style="font-style: italic">F38 Character</span>, subclass of the CIDOC CRM <span style="font-style: italic">E28 Conceptual Object</span>.
        FRBRoo <span style="font-style: italic">F38 Character</span>’s scope note says:
        <blockquote>
            “This class comprises fictional or iconographic individuals or groups of individuals (including families) appearing in works in a way relevant as subjects.
            Characters may be purely fictitious or based on real persons or groups, but as characters they may exhibit properties that would be inconsistent with a real person or group.
            Rather than merging characters with real persons, they should be described as disjoint, but related entities.”
        </blockquote>
        Lakṣmī is certainly iconographic, and her appearances in devotional literature and works of art are taken by a vast many to be based on a real (though divinely distinct from our world) person.
        The author of this page worships that Lakṣmī may be a real person in her own world, but chooses for the sake of bibliographical exactitude to specify, in this record, that disjoint but related entity that is her character self.
        Further relationships can be built from here, but this approach seems like a very safe beginning.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div style="text-align: justify">
        FRBRoo gives the relationship option <span style="font-style: italic">R57 is based on</span>, which “associates an instance of <span style="font-style: italic">F38 Character</span> with an instance of <span style="font-style: italic">E39 Actor</span> that the character is motivated by or is intended to represent.”
        However, the <span style="font-style: italic">E39 Actor</span> scope note states that “This class comprises people, either individually or in groups, who have the potential to perform intentional actions of kinds for which someone may be held responsible.”
        We've already acknowledged persons and characters being disjoint in these models we're using to bibliograph.

    <div style="text-align: justify">
        So we'll consider who she is as a <span style="font-style: italic">conceptual object</span>.
        The CRM class <span style="font-style: italic">E28 Conceptual Object</span>’s scope note gives that:
        <blockquote>
            “This class comprises non-material products of our minds and other human produced data that have become objects of a discourse about their identity, circumstances of creation or historical implication.
            The production of such information may have been supported by the use of technical devices such as cameras or computers.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            “Characteristically, instances of this class are created, invented or thought by someone, and then may be documented or communicated between persons.
            Instances of <span style="font-style: italic">E28 Conceptual Object</span> have the ability to exist on more than one particular carrier at the same time, such as paper, electronic signals, marks, audio media, paintings, photos, human memories, etc.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            “They cannot be destroyed.
            They exist as long as they can be found on at least one carrier or in at least one human memory.
            Their existence ends when the last carrier and the last memory are lost.”

            “It represents the act of conceiving the intellectual content of the <span style="font-style: italic">E28 Conceptual Object</span>.
            It does not represent the act of creating the first physical carrier of the <span style="font-style: italic">E28 Conceptual Object</span>.
            As an example, this is the composition of a poem, not its commitment to paper.”

        <span style="font-style: italic">P149 is identified by</span> identifies an instance of <span style="font-style: italic">E28 Conceptual Object</span> using an instance of <span style="font-style: italic">E41 Appellation</span>.
        Our example is that the Latin name <span style="font-weight: bold">Lakṣmī</span> is the preferred transliterate form in which many of us recognize the name which otherwise is given in Devanagari Sanskrit as <span style="font-weight: bold">लक्ष्मी</span>.

    <div style="text-align: justify">
        If we take this type of hierarchical conceptualization one step up, we have CRM class <span style="font-style: italic">E71 Man-Made Thing</span>, with its scope note:
        <blockquote>
            “This class comprises discrete, identifiable man-made items that are documented as single units.
            <br /><br />
            “These items are either intellectual products or man-made physical things, and are characterized by relative stability.
            They may for instance have a solid physical form, an electronic encoding, or they may be logical concepts or structures.”
        </blockquote>
        All <span style="font-style: italic">works</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">expressions</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">manifestations</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic">items</span> in the combined model this project uses are <span style="font-style: italic">man-made things</span>.
        Lakṣmī’s <span style="font-style: italic">F38 Character</span>ization now has a number of ways to identify and relate within this type of conceptualization, including, with the addition of <span style="font-style: italic">E71</span>, CRM properties <span style="font-style: italic">P102 has title</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">P103 was intended for</span>.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div style="text-align: justify">
        The first of the two “describes the <span style="font-style: italic">E35 Title</span> applied to an instance of <span style="font-style: italic">E71 Man-Made Thing</span>.”
        “It allows any man-made material or immaterial thing to be given a Title.”
        The term श्री (Śrī) “is used in South Asia and Southeast Asia as a polite form of address equivalent to the English ‘Mr.’ or ‘Ms.’ in written and spoken language, but also as a title of veneration for deities; for example, the Hindu goddess of wealth, Lakshmi, is known as Sree.”
    </div>
    <br />
    <div style="text-align: justify">
        The second “links an instance of <span style="font-style: italic">E71 Man-Made Thing</span> to an <span style="font-style: italic">E55 Type</span> of usage.
        It creates a property between specific man-made things, both physical and immaterial, to Types of intended methods and techniques of use.”
        <span style="font-style: italic">Works</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">expressions</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">manifestations</span> of Lakṣmī, as well as <span style="font-style: italic">items</span> representing her character and personality, are all usually: <span style="font-style: italic">P103 was intended for</span> the theistic <span style="font-style: italic">E55 Type</span> of value and utility.

        These give us a couple IFLA FRBRer attributes to describe the entity <span style="font-style: italic">frbrer:C1001 Work</span>.

        <span style="font-style: italic">P102 has title</span> actually maps to any of three FRBRer class-property combinations, including <span style="font-style: italic">frbrer:C1001 Work</span> <span style="font-style: italic">frbrer:P3001 hasTitleOfTheWork</span>, but also <span style="font-style: italic">frbrer:C1002 Expression</span> <span style="font-style: italic">frbrer:P3008 hasTitleOfTheExpression</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">frbrer:C1003 Manifestation</span> <span style="font-style: italic">frbrer:P3020 hasTitleOfTheManifestation</span>.

        My main purpose in all this elaboration of detail for this version control authority record is to link लक्ष्मी (Lakṣmī) with विष्णु (Viṣṇu).
        Hers is the truest beginning to any work I (choosing to play my own creative version of the character अग्नि (Agni)) find to be appropriate in my information conceptualization process.
        कपिध्वज (Kapidhvaja) is a name for अर्जुन (Arjuna, whose chariot bears a noteable flag), and Agni’s role in Arjuna’s acquisition of this chariot, which कृष्ण (Kṛṣṇa) drove to victory on the battlefield at कुरुक्षेत्र (Kurukṣetra), is significant to my own creation of a bibliographically three-dimensional universe of my own.
        Kapidhvaja is the name I'm using for what I'm calling my own Campaign Setting, and I draw a few links of identity connection from Agni to his own higher self त्रिविक्रम (Trivikrama), who is Viṣṇu.

    <div style="text-align: justify">
        The most direct connection I can find from Lakṣmī, as this structure is building, is through the <span style="font-style: italic">E65 Creation</span> class which is range by inversion of our CRM property <span style="font-style: italic">P94i was created by</span>.
        <span style="font-style: italic">E65 Creation</span>’s scope note tells that its “class comprises events that result in the creation of conceptual items or immaterial products, such as legends, poems, texts, music, images, movies, laws, types etc.,” and it is also the superclass of <span style="font-style: italic">E83 Type Creation</span>, a very important class.
        <span style="font-style: italic">Type Creation</span> is that class which itself creates what a class is, and so within the क्रन्दितृ (Kranditṛ) classification that I'm developing, the vocabulum <span style="font-style: italic">gratia</span>  is that entity or class which describes the quality of love shared by लक्ष्मी (Lakṣmī) and विष्णु (Viṣṇu).
    </div>
    <br />
    <div style="text-align: justify">
        Scope note is as follows:
        <blockquote>
            “This class comprises activities formally defining new types of items.
            <br /><br />
            “It is typically a rigorous scholarly or scientific process that ensures a type is exhaustively described and appropriately named.
            In some cases, particularly in archaeology and the life sciences, <span style="font-style: italic">E83 Type Creation</span> requires the identification of an exemplary specimen and the publication of the type definition in an appropriate scholarly forum.
            The activity of <span style="font-style: italic">E83 Type Creation</span> is central to research in the life sciences, where a type would be referred to as a ‘taxon,’ the type description as a ‘protologue,’ and the exemplary specimens as ‘orgininal element’ or “holotype.’”
