                    The Vedic goddess <span style="font-weight: bold">लक्ष्मी</span>, or <span style="font-weight: bold">Lakṣmī</span>, is the life within the voice of what love truly is.
                    The word “<a href="love.html">love</a>” itself maintains its own record-worthiness, but together with her masculine god <a href="विष्णु_(character).html">विष्णु</a> (Viṣṇu), Lakṣmī is the primary love goddess in this type of three-dimensional universe within which we presently live.
                    Her relationship with him is stronger than integral, and so their records each link to one another’s, as does her own identification with the vertically adjacent goddess <a href="रोहिणी_(character).html">रोहिणी</a> (Rohiṇī) have link from here.
