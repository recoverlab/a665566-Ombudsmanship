            As an IFLA FRBRoo <span style="font-style: italic">F34 KOS</span> document, which in FRSAD (section 4.2.2) was the <span style="font-style: italic">nomen</span> attribute frsad:P3004 <span style="font-style: italic">hasScheme</span>, this entity is the domain for attribute property <span style="font-style: italic">R34 has validity period</span> = FRSAD 4.2.9 or frsad:P3011 <span style="font-style: italic">hasTimeOfValidityOfNomen</span>.
            It is an <span style="font-style: italic">F2 expression</span>, and thereby a CIDOC CRM <span style="font-style: italic">E73 information object</span>, thereby an <span style="font-style: italic">E89 propositional object</span> and/or <span style="font-style: italic">E90 symbolic object</span>.
            The following excerpt from “A Strange Model Named FRBRoo” gives some thoughts on these concepts:
            <blockquote>
                “In FRBRer, the Expression entity is ‘the intellectual or artistic realization of a <span style="font-style: italic">work</span> in the form of alpha-numeric, musical, or choreographic notation, sound, image, object, movement, etc., or any combination of such forms.’
                The FRBRoo scope note for F2 Expression, while rephrasing that same definition, also insists that ‘the substance of Expression is signs,’ and F2 Expression is declared as a subclass of the CIDOC CRM class E73 Information Object, which in turn is both a subclass of E89 Propositional Object and E90 Symbolic Object.
                This implies that, although a Work can be considered independently from any of its symbolic representations (i.e., as a mere instance of E89 Propositional Object), an Expression is never taken in isolation, as a mere set of signs, but is always regarded as conveying a given set of propositions (i.e. as an instance of E89 Propositional Object <span style="font-style: italic">in addition to</span> being an instance of E90 Symbolic Object).
                It should be noted that E89 Propositional Object and E90 Symbolic Object were introduced in CIDOC CRM on the occasion of this harmonization effort between FRBR and CIDOC CRM.
                Initially, the need for a strong distinction between the conceptual content of an artistic creation and the signs that convey that conceptual content had not been felt, and E73 Information Object covered both concepts and signs (which makes sense as far as museum objects are concerned).
                The Work/Expression distinction did not fit in that construct and it proved necessary to modify CIDOC CRM in order to define FRBRoo as an extension thereof.
                It should also be noted that E89 Propositional Object does not refer only to conceptual propositions such as expressed in textual expressions, but covers any kind of notions that can be assimilated to propositions, including the concepts that inform a painting, an art print, a photograph, a piece of music, and so on.
                An expression can be complete in itself, or be just a fragment of another expression.
                This is reflected in the fact that F2 Expression has two subclasses: F22 Self-Contained Expression, and F23 Expression Fragment.”[<a href="#1">1</a>]

            Further superclassification is, of course, important.
            Initially, however, this record is trying to establish itself and build from its own foundation.
