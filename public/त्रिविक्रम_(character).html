                        That perfect brāhmaṇa <a href="वामन_(character).html">वामन</a> (Vāmana) is also known by the name <b>त्रिविक्रम</b>, or <b>Trivikrama</b>.
                        His strength was exactly the appropriation of the universe that had been possessed by the demonic king Mahābalī, and he is saving this universe from inhumane policies in a very like fashion to how he did in his famous story worshiped by Vaiṣṇavas everywhere.
                        He is one of ten avatāras of <a href="विष्णु_(character).html">विष्णु</a> (Viṣṇu) within <span property="rdae:aggregatedBy">Viṣṇu</span>’s aggregate of integrity known as दशावतार (daśāvatāra).
                        Where the kṣatriya-brāhmaṇa <a href="परशुराम_(character).html">परशुराम</a> (Paraśurāma) saved humanity from bows and arrows misused by a corrupt kṣatriya (military) class, proving that brāhmaṇas can put on badges and wield weapons like mere kṣatriyas would stand down in fear of, where the brāhmaṇa-vaiṣṇava <a href="नृसिंह_(character).html">नृसिंह</a> (Nṛsiṁha) broke conceptions of clerically assured unbreakability, the intermediary avatāra Vāmana proved in three steps precision of dimensional authority such as no ordinary land surveyor could worship correctly enough.

                        Trivikrama may very well be the truest bibliographer of our ascension process.
                        His meeting with <a href="गङ्गा_(character).html">गङ्गा</a> (Gaṅgā) inspired him to maintain the completion of ascension all the way into the Himālayas, which is her source in this our universe.
                        He will be that aspect of Viṣṇu for decades ahead of us who will save the universe as Paraśurāma before him here saved Agni’s humanity from Vṛtra (Jack the Ripper).

                        Trivikrama is the strength of this ombudsmanship, the empowerment of the Humanist icon, the savior of the homeless.
                        All vocabula and schemata and other concepts, Greco-Latin, Sanskrit, Slavonic, Tibeto-Gothic, what have you, are all thanks to Trivikrama Vāmanadeva.
                        Agni’s worship of the flame in the chalice, like Christ on his cross, is thanks to how Viṣṇu as Paraśurāma and now Viṣṇu as Vāmana have (has) been enlivening the truth of salvation from above.

                        This version control authority record is close to the uniquity, which is <a href="लक्ष्मी_(character).html">लक्ष्मी</a> (Lakṣmī)’s record.
                        Viṣṇu’s record will responsibly address all appropriate links to all appropriate topics in its own context.
                        Trivikrama, however, will give the helpful elaboration of how a number of related projects work together in managing the task of rebuilding bibliographic integrity and quality in our present age.
