            That perfect brāhmaṇa वामन (Vāmana) is also known by the name <span style="font-weight: bold">त्रिविक्रम</span>, or <span style="font-weight: bold">Trivikrama</span>.
            His strength was exactly the appropriation of the universe that had been possessed by the demonic king Mahābalī, and he is saving this universe from inhumane policies in a very like fashion to how he did in his famous story worshiped by Vaiṣṇavas everywhere.
            He is one of ten avatāras of विष्णु (Viṣṇu) within Viṣṇu’s aggregate of integrity known as दशावतार (daśāvatāra).
            Where the kṣatriya-brāhmaṇa परशुराम (Paraśurāma) saved humanity from bows and arrows misused by a corrupt kṣatriya (military) class, proving that brāhmaṇas can put on badges and wield weapons like mere kṣatriyas would stand down in fear of, where the brāhmaṇa-vaiṣṇava नृसिंह (Nṛsiṁha) broke conceptions of clerically assured unbreakability, the intermediary avatāra Vāmana proved in three steps precision of dimensional authority such as no ordinary land surveyor could worship correctly enough.

            Trivikrama may very well be the truest bibliographer of our ascension process.
            His meeting with गङ्गा (Gaṅgā) inspired him to maintain the completion of ascension all the way into the Himālayas, which is her source in this our universe.
            He will be that aspect of Viṣṇu for decades ahead of us who will save the universe as Paraśurāma before him here saved Agni’s humanity from Vṛtra (Jack the Ripper).
