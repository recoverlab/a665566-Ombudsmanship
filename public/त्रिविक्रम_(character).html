            That perfect brāhmaṇa वामन (Vāmana) is also known by the name <span style="font-weight: bold">त्रिविक्रम</span>, or <span style="font-weight: bold">Trivikrama</span>.
            His strength was exactly the appropriation of the universe that had been possessed by the demonic king Mahābalī, and he is saving this universe from inhumane policies in a very like fashion to how he did in his famous story worshiped by Vaiṣṇavas everywhere.
