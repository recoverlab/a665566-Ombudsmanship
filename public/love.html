                    The word “<span style="font-weight: bold">love</span>” is a mantra containing the first letters of their two names, “l” and “v,” as well as the famous tetragrammatical formula: Hebraic “יהוה” (YHWH), Vedic “Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Rāma,” English rock band Yes’ song “And You And I.”
                    The Sanskrit language recognizes the compound vowels “o” and “e” as being composed of “a” + “u” and “a” + “i” respectively (you can see the “a”nd “u” “a”nd “i” of the rock song, and the Hebraic “ה”s (he)s being like the “a”s in the formula, “ו” (vav) and “י” (yod) complete it).
                    The word “love” is a simple, almost magical word, mantra, formula, representation of goddess and god together.
                    It is Lakṣmī; it is Viṣṇu; it is who they as a couple truly are.

                        Idempotent Schema works with quality in a number of ways, using Kranditri vocabula to address extensions of interplanetary relativity.
                        The simplest vocabulum like is that element which gives the vocabuli entity gratia its first concept, which is love.
                        Within the scope of what true love is (and Lakṣmī and Viṣṇu) the property of शुद्ध (śuddha) gives its vocabuli entity ius the initiation of work, which is सत्त्व (sattva).
