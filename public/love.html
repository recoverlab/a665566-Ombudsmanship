                    <a href="लक्ष्मी_(character).html">लक्ष्मी</a>, or Lakṣmī, and <a href="विष्णु_(character).html">विष्णु</a>, or Viṣṇu, are the beginnings of this work and its expressions here.
                    The word “<span style="font-weight: bold">love</span>” is a mantra containing the first letters of their two names, “l” and “v,” as well as the famous tetragrammatical formula: Hebraic “יהוה” (YHWH), Vedic “Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Rāma,” English rock band Yes’ song “And You And I.”
                    The Sanskrit language recognizes the compound vowels “o” and “e” as being composed of “a” + “u” and “a” + “i” respectively (you can see the “a”nd “u” “a”nd “i” of the rock song, and the Hebraic “ה”s (he)s being like the “a”s in the formula, “ו” (vav) and “י” (yod) complete it).
                    The word “love” is a simple, almost magical word, mantra, formula, representation of goddess and god together.
                    It is Lakṣmī; it is Viṣṇu; it is who they as a couple truly are.
