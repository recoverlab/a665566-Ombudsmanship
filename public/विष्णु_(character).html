                    The Vedic god <b>विष्णु</b>, or <b>Viṣṇu</b>, is the soul whose intelligence enlivens truest love.
                    The word “<a href="love.html">love</a>” itself maintains its own record-worthiness, but together with his feminine goddess <a href="लक्ष्मी_(character).html">लक्ष्मी</a> (Lakṣmī), Viṣṇu is the primary god in this type of three-dimensional universe within which we presently live.
                    Lakṣmī’s relationship with him is the strength of love itself, so their records each link to one another’s, as does his own identification with his vertically adjacent self <a href="चन्द्र_(character).html">चन्द्र</a> (Candra) have link from here.

                    Viṣṇu is the soul of work within this expression of my ombudsmanship interest, from which further schemata and so forth might develop, and so this authority record is almost unique in its referencing of the bibliographic world beyond.
                    The bibliographic relationships this record has with other few records is mostly what the content of its intention is.
                    Attributes can be described at the <a href="https://gitlab.com/a665566/clifftop/wikis/विष्णु_(character)">next level</a> of classification, while referential focus on the entities their selves is given one level beyond that.

                        This record intends to develop a description of that aspect or version of विष्णु (Viṣṇu) which could be classified as being an IFLA FRBRoo[<a href="#1">1</a>] <i>F38 Character</i>, subclass of the CIDOC CRM[<a href="#2">2</a>] <i><a href="concept.html">E28 Conceptual Object</a></i>.
                        FRBRoo <i>F38 Character</i>’s scope note says:
                        <blockquote>
                            <div>
                                This class comprises fictional or iconographic individuals or groups of individuals (including families) appearing in works in a way relevant as subjects.
                                Characters may be purely fictitious or based on real persons or groups, but as characters they may exhibit properties that would be inconsistent with a real person or group.
                                Rather than merging characters with real persons, they should be described as disjoint, but related entities.
                            </div>
                        </blockquote>
                        Viṣṇu is certainly iconographic, and his appearances in devotional literature and works of art are taken by a vast many to be based on a real (though divinely distinct from our world) person.
                        The author of this page worships that Viṣṇu may be a real person in his own world, but the preference for bibliographical exactitude in this record is to specify that disjoint but related entity who is Viṣṇu’s character self.
                        Further relationships can be built from here, but this approach seems like a very safe beginning.
                    </div>

                    <div style="text-align: justify">
                        FRBRoo gives the relationship option <i>R57 is based on</i>, which <q>associates an instance of <i>F38 Character</i> with an instance of <i>E39 Actor</i> that the character is motivated by or is intended to represent.</q>
                        However, the <i>E39 Actor</i> scope note states that <q>This class comprises people, either individually or in groups, who have the potential to perform intentional actions of kinds for which someone may be held responsible.</q>
                        We've already acknowledged persons and characters being disjoint in these models we're using to bibliograph.

                                The activity of <i>E83 Type Creation</i> is central to research in the life sciences, where a type would be referred to as a “taxon,” the type description as a “protologue,” and the exemplary specimens as “orgininal element” or “holotype.”
