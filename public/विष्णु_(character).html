            This “Ombudsmanship” authority record may be treated as being its own expressive origin from which qualities of derivation are created.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div style="text-align: justify">
            The Vedic god <span style="font-weight: bold">विष्णु</span>, or <span style="font-weight: bold">Viṣṇu</span>, is the soul whose intelligence enlivens truest love.
            The word “<a href="love.html">love</a>” itself maintains its own record-worthiness, but together with his feminine goddess <a href="लक्ष्मी_(character).html">लक्ष्मी</a> (Lakṣmī), Viṣṇu is the primary god in this type of three-dimensional universe within which we presently live.
            Lakṣmī’s relationship with him is the strength of love itself, so their records each link to one another’s, as does his own identification with his vertically adjacent self <a href="चन्द्र_(character).html">चन्द्र</a> (Candra) have link from here.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div style="text-align: justify">
            Viṣṇu is the soul of work within this expression of my ombudsmanship interest, from which further schemata and so forth might develop, and so this authority record is almost unique in its referencing of the bibliographic world beyond.
            The bibliographic relationships this record has with other few records is mostly what the content of its intention is.
            Attributes can be described at the <a href="https://gitlab.com/a665566/clifftop/wikis/विष्णु_(character)">next level</a> of classification, while referential focus on the entities their selves is given one level beyond that.

        <br /><hr style="width: 61.8%" /><br />
        <div style="text-align: justify">
            This record intends to develop a description of that aspect or version of विष्णु (Viṣṇu) which could be classified as being an IFLA FRBRoo[<a href="#1">1</a>] <span style="font-style: italic">F38 Character</span>, subclass of the CIDOC CRM[<a href="#2">2</a>] <span style="font-style: italic"><a href="concept.html">E28 Conceptual Object</a></span>.
            FRBRoo <span style="font-style: italic">F38 Character</span>’s scope note says:
            <blockquote>
                “This class comprises fictional or iconographic individuals or groups of individuals (including families) appearing in works in a way relevant as subjects.
                Characters may be purely fictitious or based on real persons or groups, but as characters they may exhibit properties that would be inconsistent with a real person or group.
                Rather than merging characters with real persons, they should be described as disjoint, but related entities.”
            </blockquote>
            Viṣṇu is certainly iconographic, and his appearances in devotional literature and works of art are taken by a vast many to be based on a real (though divinely distinct from our world) person.
            The author of this page worships that Viṣṇu may be a real person in his own world, but the preference for bibliographical exactitude in this record is to specify that disjoint but related entity who is Viṣṇu’s character self.
            Further relationships can be built from here, but this approach seems like a very safe beginning.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div style="text-align: justify">
            FRBRoo gives the relationship option <span style="font-style: italic">R57 is based on</span>, which “associates an instance of <span style="font-style: italic">F38 Character</span> with an instance of <span style="font-style: italic">E39 Actor</span> that the character is motivated by or is intended to represent.”
            However, the <span style="font-style: italic">E39 Actor</span> scope note states that “This class comprises people, either individually or in groups, who have the potential to perform intentional actions of kinds for which someone may be held responsible.”
            We've already acknowledged persons and characters being disjoint in these models we're using to bibliograph.

            The CRM class <span style="font-style: italic">E28 Conceptual Object</span>’s scope note gives that:
            <blockquote>
                “This class comprises non-material products of our minds and other human produced data that have become objects of a discourse about their identity, circumstances of creation or historical implication.
                The production of such information may have been supported by the use of technical devices such as cameras or computers.
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                “Characteristically, instances of this class are created, invented or thought by someone, and then may be documented or communicated between persons.
                Instances of <span style="font-style: italic">E28 Conceptual Object</span> have the ability to exist on more than one particular carrier at the same time, such as paper, electronic signals, marks, audio media, paintings, photos, human memories, etc.
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                “They cannot be destroyed.
                They exist as long as they can be found on at least one carrier or in at least one human memory.
                Their existence ends when the last carrier and the last memory are lost.”

                “It represents the act of conceiving the intellectual content of the <span style="font-style: italic">E28 Conceptual Object</span>.
                It does not represent the act of creating the first physical carrier of the <span style="font-style: italic">E28 Conceptual Object</span>.

        <div style="text-align: justify">
            <span style="font-style: italic">E65 Creation</span>’s scope note tells that its “class comprises events that result in the creation of conceptual items or immaterial products, such as legends, poems, texts, music, images, movies, laws, types etc.,” and it is also the superclass of <span style="font-style: italic">E83 Type Creation</span>, a very important class.
            <span style="font-style: italic">Type Creation</span> is that class which itself creates what a class is, and so within क्रन्दितृ (Kranditṛ) classification, the <span style="font-style: italic">Type Creation</span> vocabulum <span style="font-style: italic">gratia</span>  is that entity or class which describes the quality of love shared by लक्ष्मी (Lakṣmī) and विष्णु (Viṣṇu).

            Scope note is as follows:

                In some cases, particularly in archaeology and the life sciences, <span style="font-style: italic">E83 Type Creation</span> requires the identification of an exemplary specimen and the publication of the type definition in an appropriate scholarly forum.
                The activity of <span style="font-style: italic">E83 Type Creation</span> is central to research in the life sciences, where a type would be referred to as a ‘taxon,’ the type description as a ‘protologue,’ and the exemplary specimens as ‘orgininal element’ or ‘holotype.’”

            If we take this type of hierarchical conceptualization one step up, we have CRM class <span style="font-style: italic">E71 Man-Made Thing</span>, with its scope note:

                “This class comprises discrete, identifiable man-made items that are documented as single units.
                <br /><br />

                They may for instance have a solid physical form, an electronic encoding, or they may be logical concepts or structures.”

            Viṣṇu’s <span style="font-style: italic">F38 Character</span>ization now has a number of ways to identify and relate within this type of conceptualization, including, with the addition of <span style="font-style: italic">E71</span>, CRM properties <span style="font-style: italic">P102 has title</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">P103 was intended for</span>.

            “It allows any man-made material or immaterial thing to be given a Title.”
            The term श्री (Śrī)[<a href="#3">3</a>] “is used in South Asia and Southeast Asia as a polite form of address equivalent to the English ‘Mr.’ or ‘Ms.’ in written and spoken language, but also as a title of veneration for deities; for example, the Hindu goddess of wealth, Lakshmi, is known as Sree.”

            “In the Hindu tradition,” the name हरि (Harī)[<a href="#4">4</a>] “is often used interchangeably with Vishnu to such an extent that they are considered to be one and the same.
            In Vedas, it is required to use the mantra ‘Harih om’ before any recitation, just to declare that every ritual we perform is an offer to that supreme divine even if the hymn praises any demigod.
            In Hinduism, kirtan or praise songs of any god has a common name known as Hari kirtan and katha or storytelling is known as Hari katha.”
