        Now I have two pages to work on: <a href="लक्ष्मी_(character).html">लक्ष्मी (character)</a> and <a href="विष्णु_(character).html">विष्णु (character)</a>.
        The best way I found to link to my लक्ष्मी (Lakṣmī) page began with her character self as a conceptual object being created by her conceptually objective partner character विष्णु (Viṣṇu).
        If you suspect this implies that I believe masculinity is more the creator than femininity, let me correct you.
        I just happen to be masculine, and I have yet to find femininity giving me permission to speak for it, so I'm worshiping Lakṣmī but endeavoring to make creative decisions more from Viṣṇu’s part of this, because I'm better at guessing masculine truth than feminine truth.
