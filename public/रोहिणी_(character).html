            The Vedic goddess Rohiṇī is the heart of truest love.
            She gives, to her masculine god <a href="चन्द्र.html">चन्द्र</a> (Candra), of her own superlative quality of attractiveness to draw his loving attention from anywhere he may have tried to wander, and gives their affair lasting resolve in monogamous union.
            Rohiṇī is the favorite love goddess in our type of three-dimensional universe, and is also known as the <span style="font-style: italic">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</span>’ goddess Sehanine Moonbow.
